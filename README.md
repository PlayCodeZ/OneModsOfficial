## Disclaimer

This mod was not meant for any harmful purposes, such as harming ModLabs; Quite the opposite actually.

It was made to keep ModLabs alive by the community for the community. Please use it at your own discretion

and be a Patreon backer of them, for example. Sadly, all other ways to support them aren't working anymore,

so it's the only way available currently.

[Here's their Telegram page.](https://t.me/ModLabs72)

We love ModLabs very much, and we are grateful to ModLabs developers for making such an amazing app, but unfortunately, we haven't received updates for a long time.

That's why we decided to keep ModLabs alive by making this mod, plus we don't demand any money, it's completely free :)
